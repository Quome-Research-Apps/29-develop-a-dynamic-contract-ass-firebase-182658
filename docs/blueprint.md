# **App Name**: LegisAssembler

## Core Features:

- Interactive Questionnaire: Presents a dynamic, multi-step questionnaire that adapts based on user responses to gather necessary contract details.
- Clause Library: Maintains an extensive, structured library of pre-written legal clauses with associated metadata for targeted selection. It may use AI tools for optimal matching.
- Conditional Logic Engine: Processes user answers to select relevant clauses from the library, incorporating rules to handle complex conditional logic.
- Contract Assembly: Assembles the final contract by combining selected clauses in the correct order, dynamically formatting the content based on chosen rules.
- Dynamic Document Display: Displays the finalized contract in a user-friendly textarea, allowing easy review, copying, and further editing.  The tool may include reasoning in deciding on appropriate UI formatting elements
- Data Security: Ensures all data is client-side and session-based; no data is persisted or stored after the session ends to uphold user privacy and compliance.

- Primary color: Midnight Blue (#2C3E50) to evoke professionalism and trust.
